### HTML Version (`elkin_3d_viewer.html`)

* Works in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
* No Python installation required.
* Provides fully interactive 3D visualization for small-to-medium sets (full enumeration up to ~50k points recommended).
* Large sets use GPU-friendly **sampling**, showing only a subset of points to prevent freezing.

## Usage Notes

### Python Notebook

1. Open `elkin_3d_viewer.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Adjust interactive sliders:

   * `N`: total number of points in the set.
   * `d1`, `d2`: sphere and free cylinder dimensions.
   * `Sample Ratio`: fraction of points plotted (1.0 = full set; browser-safe ≤0.1–0.2 for large N).
4. The notebook computes the full dataset in memory; sampling only affects plotting for large N.
5. Hover over points for details; change color palettes to visualize layers.
6. Export computed sets to JSON using provided cells.

**Notes on full enumeration vs sampling:**

* **Small sets** (`N ≤ 50k`): fully enumerated and plotted.
* **Medium sets** (`50k < N ≤ 1M`): sampling active for plotting; dataset still fully stored in memory.
* **Large sets** (`N > 1M`): use sampling to keep browser responsive. Full analysis still possible offline.

### HTML Viewer

1. Open `elkin_3d_viewer.html` in a browser.
2. Load example JSONs (`elkin_example_N1000.json`, `elkin_example_N100000.json`) via interface.
3. Rotate, zoom, and inspect points interactively.
4. Use color palette and optional animation controls to enhance visualization.
5. Full enumeration is feasible for `N ≤ 50k`. Larger sets will automatically display a sampled subset.

### Precomputed JSON Examples

* `elkin_example_N1000.json`: small demo set, fully enumerated.
* `elkin_example_N100000.json`: larger set with GPU-friendly plotting sampling.

These JSONs include:

* `N`: total number of integers.
* `set_size`: number of 3-AP-free elements.
* `density`: fraction of `N`.
* `parameters`: construction parameters (`d`, `d1`, `d2`, `M`, `mid`, `R2`, etc.).
* `first_20`, `last_20`: sample elements.
* `mathematical_improvement`: improvement over Behrend.
* `reference`: original paper citation.

## Documentation

* `erdos_142_elkin_cylinder_construction.md` provides **mathematical explanation** of Elkin's construction, pseudocode, and execution outputs.
* Useful for research reproducibility, reference, and linking to publications.

## Differences Between HTML and Python Versions

| Feature                      | Python Notebook              | HTML Viewer                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Computation of arbitrary `N` | ✅ Full computation possible  | ❌ Precomputed JSON or small N     |
| Full enumeration             | ✅ Up to memory limits        | ✅ Up to ~50k points               |
| GPU-friendly sampling        | ✅ Optional for large N       | ✅ Automatic for large N           |
| Interactivity                | ✅ Sliders, hover info, color | ✅ Rotate, zoom, color, animation  |
| Export results               | ✅ JSON export                | ❌ JSON export only by saving file |
| Requirement                  | Python + libraries           | Browser only                      |
